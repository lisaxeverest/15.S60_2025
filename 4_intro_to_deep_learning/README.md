# Preassignment 4

As preassignment for session 4, we'll make sure we can open and execute a notebook in Google Colab.

Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is extremely similar to Jupyter Notebook, except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!

Please go to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rCwyWnMYuy8gZWRpSSR81cblFWPyZgXr?usp=sharing) and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive. For that, please follow the instructions carefully.

Then check you can execute cells as instructed, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the requested cells.

As an additional request, we will expect you to know the basics of neural nets and how they work (e.g. backpropagation etc.). Check out https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks for beautifully animated videos on this by Grant Sanderson &Co. (his voice is beautiful too). We recommend videos 1-5 in the list, but obviously for your own interest.

See you on Thursday!
