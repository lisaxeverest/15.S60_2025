# Pre-assignment

*Note.* Any Julia version >= 1.7 is fine.

0. Please have `Gurobi` installed. If not, please install it following the instructions for the previous session.

1. Now we install `Mosek`, which is a commercial solver for solving conic convex optimization:
   * Go to https://www.mosek.com/downloads/, scroll to *Default Installers (Preferred)*, then download and install the version based on your operating system.
   
   * After that we need to get an academic license for using it. Go to https://www.mosek.com/license/request/?i=acp  and using your MIT email address, request an academic license. `Mosek` will email you (usually within minutes) the license file with instructions on how to install it. Install the license accordingly.
  
2. Next, we install the necessary `Julia` packages:
   
   * Open `Julia` REPL. Press `]` to enter package installation mode and input the following: 
     `add MosekTools, Mosek, Convex, JuMP, Ipopt, Images, DelimitedFiles, Gadfly, CSV`
   
     which besides `Mosek` installs some other packages that we will use. This includes the nonlinear solver `Ipopt`
     

If you have any issue during the installation phase, please contact `brunm@mit.edu`. **Please note that although it is a pre-assignment, you do not need to submit anything on Canvas and it is not going to be graded either.**
